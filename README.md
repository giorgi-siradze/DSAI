# DSAI (Dialectical Synthesis via AI)

<br>

## About the Repository

This project was originally created for GDG (Google Developer Groups) Hackathon hosted in Kutaisi International University in March of 2025. The theme of the Hackathon was "Edu Tech" and while our project wasn't a traditional educational program, it can still be counted as one because DSAI can be used for research. 

The goal of this project was to create a program that would automate dialectical analysis of information using Hegelian methodology.

## How to Use the Program

To successfully use the program, you would need API key from [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/).
After you obtain it, you would need to type it in this part of the code (right now it's on line 8):

```python
client = Together("api-key")
```
